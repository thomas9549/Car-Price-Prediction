# Car-Price-Prediction
In the following project, I:
-	Cleaned up and identified useful attributes and utilized pandas profiling to generate detailed reports of the data set; completed basic Principal Component Analysis with covariance and eigenvectors to reduce the dimensionality of the data set into two principal components
-	Performed data visualization using Word Cloud and Tableau to form a map view interactive dashboard and demonstrated multiple key relationships such as the positive correlation between horsepower and price; applied aggregated functions and filters to remove unnecessary biases
-	Developed multiple linear regression model, random forest model, and XGBoost model using one-hot encoding to minimize variance, biases and tackle overfitting and underfitting
-	Analyzed multiple regression metrics including the MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R squared and achieved a 0.87 r squared score with XGBoost model
